# 11_NoteTaker

This project utilizes a Heroku webpage to view a working data base that stores a user's input in a notes field which can also be deleted.

You can view this page on Heroku [here](https://peaceful-reaches-60139.herokuapp.com/).

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to successfully utilize and deploy a page to Heroku and practice my API calls.
